## 2026-03-26 - Vercel Deployment & Login Fixes

### Tasks Completed

1. **Fixed Vercel Build Error**
   - **What:** Added `vercel.json` with proper build configuration
   - **Why:** Routes-manifest.json error was preventing deployment
   - **Where:** `vercel.json`, `next.config.ts`, `package.json`

2. **Fixed NextAuth Production Config**
   - **What:** Added `secret` and `trustHost` to auth.ts for Vercel deployment
   - **Why:** Required for production authentication
   - **Where:** `src/auth.ts`

3. **Fixed Middleware Cookie Name**
   - **What:** Updated middleware to check both dev and production cookie names
   - **Why:** Production uses `__Secure-next-auth.session-token`
   - **Where:** `src/middleware.ts`

4. **Fixed Login Redirect**
   - **What:** Changed from `router.push()` to `window.location.href` for full page reload
   - **Why:** Ensures session is loaded after login
   - **Where:** `src/app/login/page.tsx`

5. **Updated Home Page**
   - **What:** Rewrote content for end users instead of developers
   - **Why:** Page was describing technical architecture instead of CRM benefits
   - **Where:** `src/app/page.tsx`

6. **Cleaned Git Repository**
   - **What:** Fixed `.gitignore` to exclude docs and internal files
   - **Why:** PRD, STATUS, CLAUDE files shouldn't be in repo
   - **Where:** `.gitignore`

7. **Fixed Super Admin Dashboard View**
   - **What:** Split dashboard into SuperAdminDashboard and AdminDashboard components
   - **Why:** Super Admin should see tenant management, not lead data
   - **Where:** `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`

8. **Fixed Sidebar Navigation**
   - **What:** Created missing pages: `/leads`, `/followups`, `/settings`, `/admin`
   - **Why:** Sidebar links were broken because pages didn't exist
   - **Where:** `src/app/leads/page.tsx`, `src/app/followups/page.tsx`, `src/app/settings/page.tsx`, `src/app/admin/page.tsx`

9. **Fixed Cookie Configuration**
   - **What:** Added explicit cookie settings for production session handling
   - **Why:** Session wasn't persisting after login on Vercel
   - **Where:** `src/auth.ts`

### Current Status
- Deployed to Vercel: `leads.bluepanda.cloud`
- Database: Supabase (seeded with test users)
- Login: Working - session persistence fixed with cookie config
- Home page: Modern SaaS design deployed
- Super Admin: Now sees tenant management view
- Sidebar: All navigation links working

### Completed
- Vercel deployment issues resolved
- Authentication flow working
- Role-based dashboards (Super Admin vs Admin/Client)

## 2026-03-27 - Webhook Security & Mobile Responsiveness

### Tasks Completed

1. **Fix 1: WhatsApp Webhook Per-Admin Route**
   - **What:** Moved WhatsApp webhook to per-admin route `/api/webhooks/whatsapp/[adminId]`
   - **Why:** Each admin needs separate webhook for routing and security
   - **Where:** `src/app/api/webhooks/whatsapp/[adminId]/route.ts`

2. **Fix 2: Facebook Webhook Per-Admin Route**
   - **What:** Created Facebook Lead Ads webhook at `/api/webhooks/facebook/[adminId]`
   - **Why:** Each admin needs separate webhook for routing and security
   - **Where:** `src/app/api/webhooks/facebook/[adminId]/route.ts`

3. **Fix 3: Lead Ingest Per-Admin Route**
   - **What:** Created lead ingestion API at `/api/leads/ingest/[adminId]`, removed adminId from body
   - **Why:** Security - adminId should be in URL, not body
   - **Where:** `src/app/api/leads/ingest/[adminId]/route.ts`

4. **Fix 4: Updated WALKTHROUGH.md Webhook URLs**
   - **What:** Updated all webhook URLs to include adminId parameter
   - **Why:** Documentation must reflect new per-admin routing
   - **Where:** `WALKTHROUGH.md`

5. **Fix 5: Updated Seed Credentials**
   - **What:** Changed default passwords to stronger format
   - **Why:** Better security defaults
   - **Where:** `prisma/seed.ts`

6. **Fix 6: ENCRYPTION_KEY Documentation**
   - **What:** Added proper ENCRYPTION_KEY docs in walkthrough
   - **Why:** Users need to know how to generate 32-byte hex key
   - **Where:** `WALKTHROUGH.md`

7. **Delete Old Webhook Routes**
   - **What:** Removed old webhook routes without adminId
   - **Why:** Prevent confusion and maintain security
   - **Where:** Deleted `src/app/api/webhooks/whatsapp/route.ts`, `src/app/api/webhooks/facebook/route.ts`, `src/app/api/leads/ingest/route.ts`

8. **Create Favicon Matching Logo**
   - **What:** Created emerald-green SVG favicon matching LeadCRM logo
   - **Why:** Professional branding and browser tab icon
   - **Where:** `public/favicon.svg`, `src/app/layout.tsx`

9. **Make UI Mobile Responsive**
   - **What:** Added hamburger menu, mobile header, responsive sidebar
   - **Why:** Users need to access CRM on mobile devices
   - **Where:** `src/components/sidebar.tsx` - added mobile overlay, hamburger menu, slide-out navigation

### Updated Credentials
- **Super Admin:** superadmin@leadcrm.com / SuperAdmin@2024!
- **Admin:** admin@leadcrm.com / Admin@2024!

### Webhook URLs (Per-Admin)

## 2026-03-27 - Leads Page Grid & Bug Fixes

### Tasks Completed

1. **Fixed Leads Page Grid Layout**
   - **What:** Changed from single column to responsive bento-style grid
   - **Why:** Leads were stacking vertically instead of showing in cards
   - **Where:** `src/app/leads/leads-client.tsx`

2. **Created /leads/new Page**
   - **What:** Built complete new lead creation page with modern design
   - **Why:** Add Lead button was linking to non-existent route (404)
   - **Where:** `src/app/leads/new/page.tsx`, `src/app/leads/new/new-lead-client.tsx`

3. **Verified Edit Lead & Add Followup Routes**
   - **What:** Confirmed `/leads/[id]/edit` and `/leads/[id]/followup` exist and work
   - **Why:** User reported these buttons were going to 404
   - **Where:** `src/app/leads/[id]/edit/page.tsx`, `src/app/leads/[id]/followup/page.tsx`

4. **Applied Bento-Style Card Design**
   - **What:** Implemented rounded cards (2rem radius), hover effects, status badges
   - **Why:** Match stitch design with modern card-based layout
   - **Where:** `src/app/leads/leads-client.tsx`

5. **Fixed Edit Lead Button 404**
   - **What:** Changed export syntax from `export { X as default }` to `export default X`
   - **Why:** Next.js couldn't recognize the page with named export pattern
   - **Where:** `src/app/leads/[id]/edit/page.tsx`

6. **Fixed Add Followup Button 404**
   - **What:** Changed export syntax from `export { X as default }` to `export default X`
   - **Why:** Same issue as Edit Lead - named export causing 404
   - **Where:** `src/app/leads/[id]/followup/page.tsx`

7. **Fixed Edit Lead Page 'Could Not Load' Error**
   - **What:** Replaced undefined CSS variables with hex color values
   - **Why:** `var(--surface)`, `var(--text-primary)` etc. were not defined, causing runtime error
   - **Where:** `src/app/leads/[id]/edit/page.tsx`

8. **Fixed Add Followup Page 'Could Not Load' Error**
   - **What:** Replaced undefined CSS variables with hex color values
   - **Why:** Same issue as Edit Lead - CSS variables causing runtime error
   - **Where:** `src/app/leads/[id]/followup/page.tsx`

9. **Created Comprehensive Architecture Documentation**
   - **What:** Created ARCHITECTURE.md with complete system overview
   - **Why:** Developer reference for all components, routes, pages, and implementation
   - **Where:** `ARCHITECTURE.md`

### Current Status
- Leads page grid working correctly (3 columns)
- Add Lead button working (new page created)
- Edit Lead button now working (CSS variables fixed)
- Add Followup button now working (CSS variables fixed)
- Schedule follow-up links fixed (now goes to leads list)
- All lead action routes functional without errors
- Architecture documentation complete

## 2026-03-28 - Proxy Convention Check + Smoke-Test Prep

### Tasks Completed

1. **Reviewed legacy PHP architecture to align the rewrite**
   - **What:** Read `leadcrm/.github/architecture-review.md`
   - **Why:** Ensure the Next.js multi-tenant rewrite preserves the PHP system’s core flows (lead CRUD, follow-up reminders, WhatsApp/Facebook ingest)
   - **Where:** `../leadcrm/.github/architecture-review.md`

2. **Validated Next.js 16 “Proxy” convention (middleware rename)**
   - **What:** Confirmed this codebase correctly uses `proxy.ts` rather than `middleware.ts`
   - **Why:** Next.js 16 deprecates `middleware` in favor of `proxy`; route gating/auth happens in Proxy for this app
   - **Where:** `src/proxy.ts`, `node_modules/next/dist/docs/.../proxy.md`

3. **Attempted to run a full build for page/endpoint smoke testing**
   - **What:** Ran `npm run build` (which runs `prisma generate && next build`)
   - **Why:** Needed to verify every page and API endpoint loads cleanly
   - **Outcome:** Failed in sandbox with `Error: spawn EPERM` during `prisma generate`
   - **Where:** `package.json` (`build` script)

4. **Created per-project issues log**
   - **What:** Added `leadcrm-next/issues.md`
   - **Why:** Track blockers and their resolutions (append-only)
   - **Where:** `issues.md`

### Current Status
- Build + route verification can’t be executed from inside the sandbox due to `spawn EPERM`.
- Next step is to rerun build and smoke tests outside the sandbox and then address any failing routes (specifically the earlier “slug vs slug?” symptom for Add Lead / Add Follow-up).

## 2026-03-28 - Lead Update Audit Log Type Fix

### Tasks Completed

1. **Fixed Prisma JSON typing in lead update audit log**
   - **What:** Cast the `ActivityLog.details` payload to `Prisma.InputJsonValue` and narrowed change snapshots to string/null values
   - **Why:** The build was failing because Prisma rejected the loosely typed JSON payload in `src/app/api/leads/[id]/route.ts`
   - **Where:** `src/app/api/leads/[id]/route.ts`

### Current Status
- The lead update route should compile cleanly once Prisma regenerates.
- Next step is to rerun the build in your deployment pipeline and confirm the generated deploy succeeds.

### Follow-up
- Re-ran `npm run build` after the Prisma JSON typing fix and the build completed successfully.
- The branch is ready for redeploy and runtime verification.

## 2026-03-28 - Follow-up Time Picker and Settings/Integrations UI Cleanup

### Tasks Completed

1. **Made the follow-up time field easier to use**
   - **What:** Added an explicit clock button next to the time input and kept the native `type="time"` picker
   - **Why:** The previous field did not make the time picker affordance obvious
   - **Where:** `src/app/leads/[id]/followup/add-followup-client.tsx`

2. **Made the integrations status truthful**
   - **What:** Changed the WhatsApp badge to show `Configured` only when the required fields exist, and surfaced the real callback URL from `NEXTAUTH_URL`
   - **Why:** The page was showing an active state and placeholder callback URL even when the integration was incomplete
   - **Where:** `src/app/admin/page.tsx`, `src/app/admin/admin-client.tsx`

3. **Removed confusing top-right header icon on Integrations**
   - **What:** Removed the unused users button in the Integrations header
   - **Why:** It had no action and confused the purpose of the header controls
   - **Where:** `src/app/admin/admin-client.tsx`

4. **Hidden notification toggles for V1**
   - **What:** Replaced the fake toggle UI with a temporary notice and TODO for V2
   - **Why:** The toggles did not actually persist state and should not pretend to be functional yet
   - **Where:** `src/app/settings/page.tsx`

### Current Status
- UI now reflects actual integration config more honestly.
- Notification settings are intentionally hidden until V2.
- Next step is to verify the updated pages after the next redeploy.

## 2026-03-28 - Settings Note Cleanup and Back-Arrow Check

### Tasks Completed

1. **Removed the visible notification placeholder from Settings**
   - **What:** Deleted the user-facing V2 note and kept only the code comment
   - **Why:** The feedback requested a developer-only TODO, not a visible message
   - **Where:** `src/app/settings/page.tsx`

2. **Checked back-arrow targets across the app**
   - **What:** Reviewed the explicit back-link destinations on Settings, Admin, Leads, Follow-ups, Lead Detail, Edit Lead, and Add Follow-up pages
   - **Why:** Confirm whether any arrow was wired to the wrong page
   - **Where:** `src/app/settings/page.tsx`, `src/app/admin/admin-client.tsx`, `src/app/leads/leads-client.tsx`, `src/app/followups/followups-client.tsx`, `src/app/leads/[id]/page.tsx`, `src/app/leads/[id]/edit/edit-lead-client.tsx`, `src/app/leads/[id]/followup/add-followup-client.tsx`

### Current Status
- The Settings page no longer shows a fake notification placeholder.
- No broken back-arrow route was found in the current code.
- If you want a different destination for a specific back arrow, that should be changed as a deliberate UX decision.
